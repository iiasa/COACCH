Zenodo
======

To upload a COACCH dataset to `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_, first `log in <https://zenodo.org/login>`_.
You can use a GitHub account, ORCID account, or a custom Zenodo account (sign up first) to log in to Zenodo.
Once logged in, you can `start an upload <https://zenodo.org/deposit>`_.

When starting an upload on Zenodo, a web form appears.
Carefully follow the instructions in the form to upload your data files and specify metadata.

In the **Communities** section of the form, type **COACCH** in the *Start typing a community name ...*  field.
An entry suggestion for the COACCH H2020 project should pop up below the field. Please select it.

Under *Upload type* select **DataSet**.

Next, in the **Basic information** section, make sure that **COACCH** is included as one of the **Keywords**.
This is required for your data set to be indexed on the `COACCH Data Index <https://iiasa.github.io/COACCH/en/master/>`_ website. Try to add further keywords that describe your data set: they make it easier to find your dataset via the search function of the COACCH Data Repository.

In the **Funding** section, set **European Comission (EU)** in the left field and type **COACCH** or **776479** in the right field. An entry suggestion matching COACCH should pop up below the right field. Please select it.

Use common sense to fill in the other meta fields.
