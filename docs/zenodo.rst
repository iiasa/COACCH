To upload a COACCH dataset to `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_, first `log in <https://zenodo.org/login>`_.
You can use a GitHub account, ORCID account, or a custom Zenodo account (sign up first) to log in to Zenodo.
Once logged in, you can `start an upload <https://zenodo.org/deposit>`_.

When starting an upload on Zenodo, a web form appears.
Carefully follow the instructions in the form to upload your data files and specify metadata.

In the **Communities** section of the form, type **COACCH** in the *Start typing a community name ...*  field.
The COACCH H2020 project should appear in the drop down below the field. Please select it.

Under **Keywords**, make sure that **COACCH** is included as one of the keywords.
This is required for your data set to be indexed on the `COACH Data Index <https://iiasa.github.io/COACCH/en/master/>`_ website.
