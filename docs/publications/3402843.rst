        <p>Our capability to adapt to extreme precipitation events is linked to our skill in predicting their magnitude and timing. Synoptic features<br>
(such as Atmospheric Rivers) developing over the North Atlantic Ocean are known as the source of the majority of water vapour transport<br>
into European mid-latitudes, and are associated with episodes of heavy and prolonged rainfall over UK and north western Europe.<br>
Thus, a better understanding of the North Atlantic atmospheric conditions prior the occurrence of extreme precipitation events over Europe<br>
could help in improving our capability to predict them. We build on atmospheric re-analyses at high spatial resolution, on a daily<br>
time scale, to highlight the anomalous path of the vertically integrated water content, transferring water from the western tropical North<br>
Atlantic to high latitudes and fuelling the storms developing in the North Atlantic sector, bound to affect Europe as responsible for the<br>
most intense precipitation events. The systematic link between anomalous north-eastward transport of vertically integrated water (precipitable<br>
water) from the western North Atlantic and anomalously high pressure patterns in the central North Atlantic, developing 5 days<br>
prior the extreme precipitation occurrence, suggest the central North Atlantic surface pressure as a potential precursor of extreme precipitation<br>
events.</p>
