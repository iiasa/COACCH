        <p>To mitigate climate change, societies strive to transform the energy sector towards greenhouse gas emission<br>
neutrality, a move which assessment studies often indicate incurs large macroeconomic costs. In this context the<br>
weighted average costs of capital (WACC) are especially important, as renewables are highly capital intensive. In<br>
particular, investors&#39; perceptions and expectations of risks are fundamental determinants of WACC and thus<br>
strongly influence the macroeconomic outcome of transition analyses. For the case of Europe&#39;s electricity sector<br>
transition, we analyze this sensitivity by choosing different WACC settings, driven also by different policy settings<br>
redirecting expectations. First, we find that when differentiating WACC across regions and technologies<br>
more accurately than usually done in the literature, immediate and substantial macroeconomic benefits from the<br>
transition emerge. We thereby reveal a systematic overestimation of low-carbon transition costs in the literature.<br>
Second, we find that when pricing-in increasing trust in renewables, these benefits get significantly larger,<br>
outweighing possible negative macroeconomic effects from the risk of stranding of fossil-based assets. We also<br>
demonstrate that in developed regions such as Europe, de-risking renewables is an effective lever for reaching<br>
climate targets, which indicates the relevance of green macroprudential regulation.</p>
