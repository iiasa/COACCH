        <p>This study aims to improve the estimates of the economic impacts of climate change by developing a river flood<br>
risk model CLIMRISK-RIVER and introducing it into an existing climate-economy integrated assessment model<br>
(IAM). It operates on a local scale and can project climate change-related river flood damage for various socioeconomic,<br>
climate and flood adaptation scenarios. Whereas other IAMs have relied on temperature as a<br>
climate change proxy, we show that precipitation is a key variable in projecting river flood damage. The way<br>
adaptation is accounted for in our flood damage functions has a large influence on the results, highlighting the<br>
relevance of modelling local level adaptation in IAMs. Results presented at different spatial scales demonstrate<br>
the relevance of river flood damage functions for estimating the economic impacts of climate change and allows<br>
for exploration of the spatial distribution of impacts through local estimates.</p>
