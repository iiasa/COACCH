        <p>Medicanes, hurricane-like cyclonic systems in the Mediterranean Sea, are<br>
becoming an increasingly severe problem for many Mediterranean countries<br>
because climate projections suggest a higher risk under anthropogenic forcing<br>
even under an intermediate scenario. Due to the small size of these weather<br>
systems, high-resolution data are required to better resolve their structure and<br>
evolution. Here we investigate medicanes from the perspective of precipitation<br>
using the high-resolution (0.25) ERA-5 reanalysis data released by European<br>
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Overall, we identify a total of<br>
59 medicanes from ERA-5 data during 1979&ndash;2017, with marked year-to-year<br>
variability. These storms tend to occur mostly between September and March.<br>
Overall, the intensity of medicanes (i.e., maximum wind) is lower than that of<br>
tropical cyclones, and this is also true for precipitation. The composite precipitation<br>
of medicanes increases from the centre to 0.8 and then decreases.<br>
During 1979&ndash;2017, many regions along the Mediterranean Sea experienced<br>
over 20 extreme precipitation events (i.e., days) which were caused by<br>
medicanes, accounting for 2&ndash;5% of all the extreme precipitation events.</p>
