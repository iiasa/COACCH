        <p>This study examines the impacts of climate change on future mortality in the<br>
Netherlands and the related economic costs. Our methods account for changes in<br>
both cold- and heat-related mortality for different age classes, the time dynamics<br>
associated with temperature-related mortality, demographic change and the urban<br>
heat island effect. Results show that heat and cold impacts on mortality vary<br>
considerably between age classes, with older people being more vulnerable to<br>
temperature extremes. The sensitivity of mortality to temperature is higher on hot<br>
(4.6%/&deg;C) than cold (2.1%/&deg;C) days for the most vulnerable group (&ge; 80 years),<br>
and extreme temperatures have long time lags on mortality, especially in the cold.<br>
A main finding is that climate change is expected to first decrease total net<br>
mortality in the Netherlands due to a dominant effect of less cold-related mortality,<br>
but this reverses over time under high warming scenarios, unless additional adaptation<br>
measures are taken. The economic valuation of these total net mortality<br>
changes indicates that climate change will result in net benefits of up to &euro;2.3<br>
billion using the Value of a Statistical Life Year and &euro;14.5 billion using the Value<br>
of a Statistical Life approaches in 2050, while this changes over time in net<br>
economic costs under high warming scenarios that can reach up to &euro;17.6 billion<br>
in 2085. Implementing adaptation policies that reduce the negative impacts of<br>
warming on mortality in the heat can turn these net costs into net benefits by<br>
achieving a continued dominating effect of reduced mortality in the cold.</p>
